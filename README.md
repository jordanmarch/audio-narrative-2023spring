# **"Wake Me in The Future" - My Final Audio Narrative:**

My soundscape, “Wake Me in The Future”, takes listeners through a morning in my life on a school day but with a twist. I have a virtual voice assistant guiding me through the motions of getting up, getting ready, getting out the door, and getting to class. However, in the end listeners find out the futuristic reality was in fact not reality; it was all a dream, and I overslept.

**My original audio narrative idea and plan:**

For my audio narrative I am planning on running through my morning routine/walk to class but in a sort of futuristic world. This idea is kind of inspired by the movie Her, there will be a virtual assistant speaking throughout the routine and assisting me along the way. I’ll get ready, walk down Forbes, etc. etc. but it’ll be condensed and not real time. All will be well for most of the audio, until the end when reality gets confusing and the virtual assistants voice gets wonky and morphs into a human voice. Listeners will realize I overslept, was dreaming, and now my roommate is waking me in a frenzy. 

**Progress Thurs 1/26:**

So far I have pieced together the very beginnings of my story. In the preview you hear my heater turn on, which is followed by my alarm going off and being turned off, and bed sheets rustling. I've been recording sounds I need to move forward. My next steps are adding those to the audacity project and sourcing more sounds. I added the recording of feeding my cat to the project, but need to fill in the gap between the alarm going off and that. I will include opening my blinds, foot steps (possibly from carpet to hardwood), and cat meows. I am hoping to do more with the audio being left/right to try and immitate what I hear each morning and to pull the listener into the story, but my headphones weren't working so I need to figure that out first. 


**Reflection:**

For my soundscape, “Wake Me in The Future”, I chose to take listeners through a morning in my life on a school day but with a twist. I decided to have a virtual voice assistant guide me through the motions of getting up, getting ready, getting out the door, and getting to class. However, in the end, listeners find out the futuristic reality was in fact not reality; it was all a dream, and I overslept. This was my first experience truly using an audio editor aside from messing around on garage band in middle school. My main goal was to become comfortable with the basics of Audacity and learn a few special tools and effects, which I think I achieved.  

At the beginning of my soundscape, I wanted to gradually introduce the listener to the scene and make them feel like they were waking up too. The first sound is my heater turning on, which I often hear as I wake up, and this remains a constant background noise for the first half or so of the project. Then the alarm goes off, breaking the quiet atmosphere abruptly. Again, I hoped this would make the listener feel like they were waking up.  

When we had to upload our draft, I struggled pushing the entire, longer files to my repository. Because of this most of the feedback I received was on my first preview, but it was still useful! One peer review suggested adding background music.

When I was first creating my narrative, I considered adding music to my walk, but decided against it because I thought it would take away from the sounds on the street. With this comment, I chose to reconsider my initial choice and added a lo-fi song when the virtual assistant asks if I want to listen to music. I tried to find a song that I actually listen to, but it was challenging to find one that I had the rights to. With this song I had it fade in and kept the audio all on the left side since I normally only wear one air pod when walking. I think the lo-fi song without words and music in one ear was the right choice because it doesn’t take away from the other essential noises, and it immerses the listener more.

Post-first-draft was when I really focused on implementing special things beyond bare-bone cutting and moving things around. I focused a lot on this at the end of the soundscape when the “walk sign is on to cross Forbes” gets all funky and I come out of the dream back to reality. I wanted listeners to feel immersed in the confusion of this moment, which I attempted to capture with the small clips fading in/out and jumping from right ear to left.

I believe I easily met all the baseline criteria. My narrative without the audio credits is about 3.5 minutes, which falls within the time requirements. I also have a mixture of sounds I recorded myself and sounds not recorded by me that I had permission to use. You can see these on my asset page where all credit is given (TASL!). Throughout a lot of my project, I have 3 or more sounds overlapping (especially at the end, as there’s a lot going on). There is also a change in location throughout my piece from my bed all the way to Forbes and an event when we realize it was a dream. I also used the fade-in and out effects from the “effects” menu quite a bit throughout the piece.  

As far as aspirational criteria go, a big thing I did was change the volume and left/right pan. This was done at the beginning with the heater and the alarm, with the cat's meows getting louder as she gets closer, with the music, noises on the street, etc. I think the most unique element of my narrative and its story is the virtual, siri/alexa-esque voice assistant. I figured out how to generate this online and it fit my intended goal of it sounding like a fake voice, not a real person. I wanted it to be obvious to viewers that a real person wasn’t following me around and speaking with me and that I was in a futuristic reality.
