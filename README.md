**My audio narrative idea and plan:**

For my audio narrative I am planning on running through my morning routine/walk to class but in a sort of futuristic world. This idea is kind of inspired by the movie Her, there will be a virtual assistant speaking throughout the routine and assisting me along the way. I’ll get ready, walk down Forbes, etc. etc. but it’ll be condensed and not real time. All will be well for most of the audio, until the end when reality gets confusing and the virtual assistants voice gets wonky and morphs into a human voice. Listeners will realize I overslept, was dreaming, and now my roommate is waking me in a frenzy. 

**Progress Thurs 1/26:**

So far I have pieced together the very beginnings of my story. In the preview you hear my heater turn on, which is followed by my alarm going off and being turned off, and bed sheets rustling. I've been recording sounds I need to move forward. My next steps are adding those to the audacity project and sourcing more sounds. I added the recording of feeding my cat to the project, but need to fill in the gap between the alarm going off and that. I will include opening my blinds, foot steps (possibly from carpet to hardwood), and cat meows. I am hoping to do more with the audio being left/right to try and immitate what I hear each morning and to pull the listener into the story, but my headphones weren't working so I need to figure that out first.
